ID="p2" N="2"><L>Colossal Power with overwhelming force</L><L>Bears down each fort of Freedom in its course;</L><L>Prostrate she lies beneath the Despot's sway,</L><L>While the hushed nations curse him&mdash;and obey.</L></LG><LG

TYPE="stanza"><L REND="indent1">Bounteous in vain, with frantic man at strife,</L><L>Glad Nature pours the means&mdash;the joys of life;</L><L>In vain with orange blossoms scents the gale,</L><L>The hills with olives clothes, with corn the vale;</L><L>Man calls to Famine, nor invokes in vain,</L><L>Disease and Rapine follow in her train;</L><L>The tramp of marching hosts disturbs the plough,</L><L>The sword, not sickle, reaps the harvest now,</L><L>And where the Soldier gleans the scant supply,</L><L>The helpless Peasant but retires to die;</L><PB

ID="p3" N="3"><L>No laws his hut from licensed outrage shield,</L><L>And war's least horror is the ensanguined field.</L></LG><LG

ID="p4" N="4"><L>Or the spread map with anxious eye explores,</L><L>Its dotted boundaries and penciled shores,</L><L>Asks <EMPH

TYPE="stanza"><L REND="indent1">And thinks't thou, Britain, still to sit at ease,</L><L>An island Queen amidst thy subject seas,</L><L>While the vext billows, in their distant roar,</L><L>But soothe thy slumbers, and but kiss thy shore?</L><L>To sport in wars, while danger keeps aloof,</L><L>Thy grassy turf unbruised by hostile hoof?</L><L>So sing thy flatterers; but, Britain, know,</L><L>Thou who hast shared the guilt must share the woe.</L><L>Nor distant is the hour; low murmurs spread,</L><L>And whispered fears, creating what they dread;</L><PB

ID="p5" N="5"><L>Ruin, as with an earthquake shock, is here,</L><L>There, the heart-witherings of unuttered fear,</L><L>And that sad death, whence most affection bleeds,</L><L>Which sickness, only of the soul, precedes.</L><L>Thy baseless wealth dissolves in air away,</L><L>Like mists that melt before the morning ray:</L><L>No more on crowded mart or busy street</L><L>Friends, meeting friends, with cheerful hurry greet;</L><L>Sad, on the ground thy princely merchants bend</L><L>Their altered looks, and evil days portend,</L><L>And fold their arms, and watch with anxious breast</L><L>The tempest blackening in the distant West.</L></LG><LG

TYPE="stanza"><L REND="indent1">Yes, thou must droop; thy Midas dream is o'er;</L><L>The golden tide of Commerce leaves thy shore,</L><PB

ID="p6" N="6"><L>Leaves thee to prove the alternate ills that haunt</L><L>Enfeebling Luxury and ghastly Want;</L><L>Leaves thee, perhaps, to visit distant lands,</L><L>And deal the gifts of Heaven with equal hands.</L></LG><LG

TYPE="stanza"><L REND="indent1">Yet, O my Country, name beloved, revered,</L><L>By every tie that binds the soul endeared,</L><L>Whose image to my infant senses came</L><L>Mixt with Religion's light and Freedom's holy flame!</L><L>If prayers may not avert, if 'tis thy fate</L><L>To rank amongst the names that once were great,</L><L>Not like the dim cold Crescent shalt thou fade,</L><L>Thy debt to Science and the Muse unpaid;</L><L>Thine are the laws surrounding states revere,</L><L>Thine the full harvest of the mental year,</L><PB

ID="p7" N="7"><L>Thine the bright stars in Glory's sky that shine,</L><L>And arts that make it life to live are thine.</L><L>If westward streams the light that leaves thy shores,</L><L>Still from thy lamp the streaming radiance pours.</L><L>Wide spreads thy race from Ganges to the pole,</L><L>O'er half the western world thy accents roll:</L><L>Nations beyond the Apalachian hills</L><L>Thy hand has planted and thy spirit fills:</L><L>Soon as their gradual progress shall impart</L><L>The finer sense of morals and of art,</L><L>Thy stores of knowledge the new states shall know,</L><L>And think thy thoughts, and with thy fancy glow;</L><L>Thy Lockes, thy Paleys shall instruct their youth,   </L><L>Thy leading star direct their search for truth;</L><PB

ID="p9" N="9"><L>Some youthful Basil from thy moral lay</L><L>With stricter hand his fond desires shall sway;</L><L>Some Ethwald, as the fleeting shadows pass,</L><L>Start at his likeness in the mystic glass;</L><L>The tragic Muse resume her just controul,</L><L>With pity and with terror purge the soul,</L><L>While wide o'er transatlantic realms thy name</L><L>Shall live in light, and gather <EMPH
