            <p>The following Poem is intended to describe the mental conflicts,  as well as outward sufferings, of a Spaniard, who, flying from the religious persecutions of his own country in the 16th century, takes refuge with his child in a North American  forest. The story is supposed to be related by himself amidst the wilderness which has afforded him an asylum.</p>

                    <p>"I recollect hearing a traveller, of poetical temperament, expressing the kind of horror which he felt on beholding, on the banks of the Missouri, an oak of prodigious size, which had been in a manner overpowered by an enormous wild grape&#xAD;vine. The vine had clasped its huge folds round the trunk, and from thence had wound about every branch and twig, until the mighty tree had withered in its embrace. It seemed like Laocoon struggling ineffectually in the hideous coils of the monster Python."&#x2014; Bracebridge Hall. Chapter on Forest Trees.</p>

                    <p>"A priest, named Gonzalez, had, among other proselytes,
gained over two young females, his sisters, to the protestant
faith. All three were confined in the dungeons of the Inquisition.<pb id="p93" n="93">The torture, repeatedly applied, could not draw from them the
least evidence against their religious associates. Every artifice was employed to obtain a recantation from the two sisters, since the constancy and learning of Gonzalez precluded all hopes of a theological victory. Their answer, if not exactly logical, is wonderfully simple and affecting. 'We will die in the faith of our brother: he is too wise to be wrong, and too good to deceive us.'&#x2014;The three stakes on which they died were near each other. The priest had been gagged till the moment of lighting up the wood. The few minutes that he was allowed to speak he employed in comforting his sisters, with whom he sung the 109th Psalm, till the flames smothered their voices."&#x2014;Ibid.</pb></p>

                          <p>Many striking instances of the vividness with which the mind,
when strongly excited, has been known to renovate past impressions, and embody them into visible imagery, are noticed and accounted for in Dr. Hibbert's Philosophy of Apparitions. The following illustrative passage is quoted in the same work, from the writings of the late Dr. Ferriar. "I remember that, about the age of fourteen, it was a source of great amusement to myself, if I had been viewing any interesting object in the course of the day, such as a romantic ruin, a fine seat, or a review of a body of
troops, as soon as evening came on, if I had occasion to go into a dark room, the whole scene was brought before my eyes with a brilliancy equal to what it had possessed in daylight, and remained visible for several minutes. I have no doubt that dismal and frightful images have been thus presented to young persons after scenes of domestic affliction or public horror."</p>
                          <p>The following passage from the "Alcazar of Seville," a tale,
or historical sketch, by the author of Doblado's letters, affords a
<pb id="p97" n="97">further illustration of this subject. "When, descending fast
into the vale of years, I strongly fix my mind's eye on those
narrow, shady, silent streets, where I breathed the scented air which came rustling through the surrounding groves; where the footsteps re&#xAD;echoed from the clean watered porches of the houses, and where every object spoke of quiet and contentment; . . . . . . . . . . the objects around me begin to fade into a mere delusion, and not only the thoughts, but the external sensations, which I then experience, revive with a reality that almost makes me shudder&#x2014;it has so much the character of a trance, or vision."</pb></p>

<pb id="p98" n="98">we have long been separated. Among the Portugueze and the Spaniards, peculiar motives seem to increase this feeling; a religious sentiment attaches them to a constellation, the form of which recals the sign of the faith planted by their ancestors in the deserts of the New World.  . . . . . . . . . . . . It has been observed at what hour of the night, in different seasons, the Cross of the South is erect or inclined. It is a time&#xAD;piece that advances very regularly near four minutes a day, and no other group of stars exhibits to the naked eye an observation of time so easily made. How often have we heard our guides exclaim, in the savannahs of Venezuela, or in the desert extending from Lima to Truxillo, "Midnight is past, the cross begins to bend!" How often these words reminded us of that affecting scene where Paul and Virginia, seated near the source of the river of Lataniers,
conversed together for the last time, and where the old man, at the sight of the Southern Cross, warns them that it is time to separate!"&#x2014;De Humboldt's Travels.</pb></p>

                        <opener>When a Northern chief fell gloriously in war, his obsequies were honoured with<lb>all possible magnificence.

His dependants and friends frequently made it a point of honour<lb>to die with their leader, in order to attend on his shade in Valhalla, or the<lb>Palace of Odin. And lastly, his wife was generally consumed with him on<lb>the same pile.</lb></lb></lb></lb></lb></lb></opener>
