          <head teiform="head">PREFACE. </head>
          <p teiform="p">T<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">HE</hi> first Volume of these Poems has already been submitted to general perusal.  It was published, as an experiment, which, I hoped, might be of some use to ascertain, how far, by fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of the real language of men in a state of vivid sensation, that sort of pleasure and that quantity of pleasure may be imparted, which a Poet may rationally endeavour to impart.</p>
          <p teiform="p">I had formed no very inaccurate estimate of the probable effect of those Poems: I flattered myself <pb n="ii" teiform="pb"/><lb teiform="lb"/><lb teiform="lb"/>that they who should be pleased with them would read them with more than common pleasure: and, on the other hand, I was well aware, that by those who should dislike them they would be read with more than common dislike.  The result has differed from my expectation in this only, that I have pleased a greater number, than I ventured to hope I should please.</p>
          <p teiform="p">For the sake of variety, and from a consciousness of my own weakness, I was induced to request the assistance of a Friend, who furnished me with the Poems of the A<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">NCIENT</hi> M<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">ARINER</hi>, the F<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">OSTER</hi>-M<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">OTHER[rsquo ]S</hi> T<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">ALE</hi>, the N<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">IGHTINGALE</hi>, and the Poem entitled L<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">OVE</hi>.  I should not, however, have requested this assistance, had I not believed that the Poems of my Friend would in a great measure have the same tendency as my own, and that, though there would be found a difference, <pb n="iii" teiform="pb"/><lb teiform="lb"/><lb teiform="lb"/>there would be found no discordance in the colours of our style; as our opinions on the subject of poetry do almost entirely coincide.</p>
          <p teiform="p">Several of my Friends are anxious for the success of these Poems from a belief, that, if the views with which they were composed were indeed realized, a class of Poetry would be produced, well adapted to interest mankind permanently, and not unimportant in the multiplicity, and in the quality of its moral relations: and on this account they have advised me to prefix a systematic defence of the theory upon which the poems were written.  But I was unwilling to undertake the task, because I knew that on this occasion the Reader would look coldly upon my arguments, since I might be suspected of having been principally influenced by the selfish and foolish hope of <emph teiform="emph">reasoning</emph> him into an approbation of these particular Poems: and I was still more unwilling to undertake the <pb n="iv" teiform="pb"/>task, because, adequately to display my opinions, and fully to enforce my arguments, would require a space wholly disproportionate to the nature of a preface.  For to treat the subject with the clearness and coherence, of which I believe it susceptible, it would be necessary to give a full account of the present state of the public taste in this country, and to determine how far this taste is healthy or depraved; which, again, could not be determined, without pointing out, in what manner language and the human mind act and re-act on each other, and without retracing the revolutions, not of literature alone, but likewise of society itself.  I have therefore altogether declined to enter regularly upon this defence; yet I am sensible, that there would be some impropriety in abruptly obtruding upon the Public, without a few words of introduction, Poems so materially different from those, upon which general approbation is at present bestowed.</p>
          <pb n="v" teiform="pb"/>
          <p teiform="p">It is supposed, that by the act of writing in verse an Author makes a formal engagement that he will gratify certain known habits of association; that he not only thus apprizes the Reader that certain classes of ideas and expressions will be found in his book, but that others will be carefully excluded.  This exponent or symbol held forth by metrical language must in different [aelig ]ras of literature have excited very different expectations: for example, in the age of Catullus, Terence and Lucretius, and that of Statius or Claudian; and in our own country, in the age of Shakespeare and Beaumont and Fletcher, and that of Donne and Cowley, or Dryden, or Pope.  I will not take upon me to determine the exact import of the promise which by the act of writing in verse an Author, in the present day, makes to his Reader; but I am certain, it will appear to many persons that I have not fulfilled the terms of an engagement thus voluntarily contracted.  They <pb n="vi" teiform="pb"/>who have been accustomed to the gaudiness and inane phraseology of many modern writers, if they persist in reading this book to its conclusion, will, no doubt, frequently have to struggle with feelings of strangeness and aukwardness: they will look round for poetry, and will be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts can be permitted to assume that title.  I hope therefore the Reader will not censure me, if I attempt to state what I have proposed to myself to perform; and also, (as far as the limits of a preface will permit) to explain some of the chief reasons which have determined me in the choice of my purpose: that at least he may be spared any unpleasant feeling of disappointment, and that I myself may be protected from the most dishonourable accusation which can be brought against an Author, namely, that of an indolence which prevents him from endeavouring to ascertain what is his duty, or <pb n="vii" teiform="pb"/>when his duty is ascertained, prevents him from performing it.</p>
          <p teiform="p">The principal object, then, which I proposed to myself in these Poems was to choose incidents and situations from common life, and to relate or describe them, throughout, as far as was possible, in a selection of language really used by men; and, at the same time, to throw over them a certain colouring of imagination, whereby ordinary things should be presented to the mind in an unusual way; and, further, and above all, to make these incidents and situations interesting by tracing in them, truly though not ostentatiously, the primary laws of our nature: chiefly, as far as regards the manner in which we associate ideas in a state of excitement. Low and rustic life was generally chosen, because in that condition, the essential passions of the heart find a better soil in which they can attain their maturity, <pb n="viii" teiform="pb"/>are less under restraint, and speak a plainer and more emphatic language; because in that condition of life our elementary feelings co-exist in a state of greater simplicity, and, consequently, may be more accurately contemplated, and more forcibly communicated; because the manners of rural life germinate from those elementary feelings; and, from the necessary character of rural occupations, are more easily comprehended; and are more durable; and lastly, because in that condition the passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature.  The language, too, of these men is adopted (purified indeed from what appear to be its real defects, from all lasting and rational causes of dislike or disgust) because such men hourly communicate with the best objects from which the best part of language is originally derived; and because, from their rank in society and the sameness and narrow circle of their intercourse, being <pb n="ix" teiform="pb"/>less under the action of social vanity they convey their feelings and notions in simple and unelaborated expressions.  Accordingly, such a language, arising out of repeated experience and regular feelings, is a more permanent, and a far more philosophical language, than that which is frequently substituted for it by Poets, who think that they are conferring honour upon themselves and their art, in proportion as they separate themselves from the sympathies of men, and indulge in arbitrary and capricious habits of expression, in order to furnish food for fickle tastes, and fickle appetites, of their own creation*.</p>
          <p teiform="p">I cannot, however, be insensible of the present <note place="foot" anchored="yes" teiform="note">* It is worth while here to observe that the affecting parts of Chaucer are almost always expressed in language pure and universally intelligible even to this day.</note><pb n="x" teiform="pb"/>outcry against the triviality and meanness both of thought and language, which some of my contemporaries have occasionally introduced into their metrical compositions; and I acknowledge that this defect, where it exists, is more dishonourable to the Writer[rsquo ]s own character than false refinement or arbitrary innovation, though I should contend at the same time that it is far less pernicious in the sum of its consequences. From such verses the Poems in these volumes will be found distinguished at least by one mark of difference, that each of them has a worthy <emph teiform="emph">purpose</emph>.  Not that I mean to say, that I always began to write with a distinct purpose formally conceived; but I believe that my habits of meditation have so formed my feelings, as that my descriptions of such objects as strongly excite those feelings, will be found to carry along with them a <emph teiform="emph">purpose</emph>.  If in this opinion I am mistaken, I can have little right to the name of a Poet.  For all good poetry is the <pb n="xi" teiform="pb"/>spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: but though this be true, Poems to which any value can be attached, were never produced on any variety of subjects but by a man, who being possessed of more than usual organic sensibility, had also thought long and deeply.  For our continued influxes of feeling are modified and directed by our thoughts, which are indeed the representatives of all our past feelings; and, as by contemplating the relation of these general representatives to each other we discover what is really important to men, so, by the repetition and continuance of this act, our feelings will be connected with important subjects, till at length, if we be originally possessed of much sensibility, such habits of mind will be produced, that, by obeying blindly and mechanically the impulses of those habits, we shall describe objects, and utter sentiments, of such a nature and in such connection with each other, that the understanding of the <pb n="xii" teiform="pb"/>being to whom we address ourselves, if he be in a healthful state of association, must necessarily be in some degree enlightened, and his affections ameliorated.</p>
          <p teiform="p">I have said that each of these poems has a purpose.  I have also informed my Reader what this purpose will be found principally to be: namely, to illustrate the manner in which our feelings and ideas are associated in a state of excitement.  But, speaking in language somewhat more appropriate, it is to follow the fluxes and refluxes of the mind when agitated by the great and simple affections of our nature. This object I have endeavoured in these short essays to attain by various means; by tracing the maternal passion through many of its more subtle windings, as in the poems of the I<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">DIOT</hi> B<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">OY</hi> and the M<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">AD</hi> M<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">OTHER</hi>; by accompanying the last struggles of a human being, at the approach of death, <pb n="xiii" teiform="pb"/>cleaving in solitude to life and society, as in the Poem of the F<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">ORSAKEN</hi> I<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">NDIAN</hi>; by showing, as in the Stanzas entitled W<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">E ARE </hi>S<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">EVEN</hi>, the perplexity and obscurity which in childhood attend our notion of death, or rather our utter inability to admit that notion; or by displaying the strength of fraternal, or to speak more philosophically, of moral attachment when early associated with the great and beautiful objects of nature, as in T<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">HE</hi> B<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">ROTHERS</hi>; or, as in the Incident of S<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">IMON</hi> L<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">EE</hi>, by placing my Reader in the way of receiving from ordinary moral sensations another and more salutary impression than we are accustomed to receive from them. It has also been part of my general purpose to attempt to sketch characters under the influence of less impassioned feelings, as in the T<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">WO</hi> A<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">PRIL</hi> M<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">ORNINGS</hi>, T<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">HE</hi> F<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">OUNTAIN</hi>, T<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">HE</hi> O<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">LD</hi> M<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">AN TRAVELLING</hi>, T<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">HE TWO</hi> T<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">HIEVES</hi>, [amp   ]c. characters of which the elements are simple, belonging <pb n="xiv" teiform="pb"/>rather to nature than to manners, such as exist now, and will probably always exist, and which from their constitution may be distinctly and profitably contemplated.  I will not abuse the indulgence of my Reader by dwelling longer upon this subject; but it is proper that I should mention one other circumstance which distinguishes these Poems from the popular Poetry of the day; it is this, that the feeling therein developed gives importance to the action and situation, and not the action and situation to the feeling.  My meaning will be rendered perfectly intelligible by referring my Reader to the Poems entitled P<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">OOR</hi> S<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">USAN</hi> and the C<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">HILDLESS</hi> F<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">ATHER</hi>, particularly to the last Stanza of the latter Poem.</p>
          <p teiform="p">I will not suffer a sense of false modesty to prevent me from asserting, that I point my Reader[rsquo ]s attention to this mark of distinction, far less for the sake of these particular Poems than from the <pb n="xv" teiform="pb"/>general importance of the subject.  The subject is indeed important!  For the human mind is capable of being excited without the application of gross and violent stimulants; and he must have a very faint perception of its beauty and dignity who does not know this, and who does not further know, that one being is elevated above another, in proportion as he possesses this capability.  It has therefore appeared to me, that to endeavour to produce or enlarge this capability is one of the best services in which, at any period, a Writer can be engaged; but this service, excellent at all times, is especially so at the present day. For a multitude of causes, unknown to former times, are now acting with a combined force to blunt the discriminating powers of the mind, and unfitting it for all voluntary exertion to reduce it to a state of almost savage torpor.  The most effective of these causes are the great national <pb n="xvi" teiform="pb"/>events which are daily taking place, and the increasing accumulation of men in cities, where the uniformity of the occupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident, which the rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifies. To this tendency of life and manners the literature and theatrical exhibitions of the country have conformed themselves.  The invaluable works of our elder writers, I had almost said the works of Shakespear and Milton, are driven into neglect by frantic novels, sickly and stupid German Tragedies, and deluges of idle and extravagant stories in verse.[mdash ]When I think upon this degrading thirst after outrageous stimulation, I am almost ashamed to have spoken of the feeble effort with which I have endeavoured to counteract it; and, reflecting upon the magnitude of the general evil, I should be oppressed with no dishonorable melancholy, had I not a deep impression of certain <pb n="xvii" teiform="pb"/>inherent and indestructible qualities of the human mind, and likewise of certain powers in the great and permanent objects that act upon it, which are equally inherent and indestructible; and did I not further add to this impression a belief, that the time is approaching when the evil will be systematically opposed, by men of greater powers, and with far more distinguished success.</p>
          <p teiform="p">Having dwelt thus long on the subjects and aim of these Poems, I shall request the Reader[rsquo ]s permission to apprize him of a few circumstances relating to their <emph teiform="emph">style</emph>, in order, among other reasons, that I may not be censured for not having performed what I never attempted.  The Reader will find that personifications of abstract ideas rarely occur in these volumes; and, I hope, are utterly rejected as an ordinary device to elevate the style, and raise it above prose.  I have pro-<pb n="xviii" teiform="pb"/>posed to myself to imitate, and, as far as is possible, to adopt the very language of men; and assuredly such personifications do not make any natural or regular part of that language.  They are, indeed, a figure of speech occasionally prompted by passion, and I have made use of them as such; but I have endeavoured utterly to reject them as a mechanical device of style, or as a family language which Writers in metre seem to lay claim to by prescription.  I have wished to keep my Reader in the company of flesh and blood, persuaded that by so doing I shall interest him.  I am, however, well aware that others who pursue a different track may interest him likewise; I do not interfere with their claim, I only wish to prefer a different claim of my own.  There will also be found in these volumes little of what is usually called poetic diction; I have taken as much pains to <pb n="xix" teiform="pb"/>avoid it as others ordinarily take to produce it; this I have done for the reason already alleged, to bring my language near to the language of men, and further, because the pleasure which I have proposed to myself to impart is of a kind very different from that which is supposed by many persons to be the proper object of poetry.  I do not know how, without being culpably particular, I can give my Reader a more exact notion of the style in which I wished these poems to be written than by informing him that I have at all times endeavoured to look steadily at my subject, consequently, I hope that there is in these Poems little falsehood of description, and that my ideas are expressed in language fitted to their respective importance.  Something I must have gained by this practice, as it is friendly to one property of all good poetry, namely good sense; but it has necessarily cut me off from a large portion of phrases and figures of speech which from <pb n="xx" teiform="pb"/>father to son have long been regarded as the common inheritance of Poets.  I have also thought it expedient to restrict myself still further, having abstained from the use of many expressions, in themselves proper and beautiful, but which have been foolishly repeated by bad Poets, till such feelings of disgust are connected with them as it is scarcely possible by any art of association to overpower.</p>
          <p teiform="p">If in a poem there should be found a series of lines, or even a single line, in which the language, though naturally arranged, and according to the strict laws of metre, does not differ from that of prose, there is a numerous class of critics, who, when they stumble upon these prosaisms, as they call them, imagine that they have made a notable discovery, and exult over the Poet as over a man ignorant of his own profession.  Now these men would establish a canon of criticism which the <pb n="xxi" teiform="pb"/>Reader will conclude he must utterly reject, if he wishes to be pleased with these volumes.  And it would be a most easy task to prove to him, that not only the language of a large portion of every good poem, even of the most elevated character, must necessarily, except with reference to the metre, in no respect differ from that of good prose, but likewise that some of the most interesting parts of the best poems will be found to be strictly the language of prose, when prose is well written. The truth of this assertion might be demonstrated by innumerable passages from almost all the poetical writings, even of Milton himself.  I have not space for much quotation; but, to illustrate the subject in a general manner, I will here adduce a short composition of Gray, who was at the head of those who, by their reasonings, have attempted to widen the space of separation betwixt Prose and Metrical composition, and was more than any other man <pb n="xxii" teiform="pb"/>curiously elaborate in the structure of his own poetic diction. <q direct="unspecified" teiform="q"><lg type="stanza" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="n" teiform="lg"><l part="n" teiform="l">In vain to me the smiling mornings shine,</l><l part="n" teiform="l">And reddening Ph[oelig ]bus lifts his golden fire:</l><l part="n" teiform="l">The birds in vain their amorous descant join,</l><l part="n" teiform="l">Or cheerful fields resume their green attire.</l><l part="n" teiform="l">These ears alas! for other notes repine;</l><l part="n" teiform="l"><emph teiform="emph">A different object do these eyes require;</emph></l><l part="n" teiform="l"><emph teiform="emph">My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine;</emph></l><l part="n" teiform="l"><emph teiform="emph">And in my breast the imperfect joys expire;</emph></l><l part="n" teiform="l">Yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer,</l><l part="n" teiform="l">And new-born pleasure brings to happier men;</l><l part="n" teiform="l">The fields to all their wonted tribute bear;</l><l part="n" teiform="l">To warm their little loves the birds complain.</l><l part="n" teiform="l"><emph teiform="emph">I fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear,</emph></l><l part="n" teiform="l"><emph teiform="emph">And weep the more because I weep in vain.</emph></l></lg></q>It will easily by perceived that the only part of this Sonnet which is of any value is the lines printed in Italics: it is equally obvious, that, except in the rhyme, and in the use of the single word [ldquo ]fruitless[rdquo ] for fruitlessly, which is so far a defect, the language of these lines does in no respect differ from that of prose.</p>
          <pb n="xxiii" teiform="pb"/>
          <p teiform="p">By the foregoing quotation I have shown that the language of Prose may yet be well adapted to Poetry; and I have previously asserted that a large portion of the language of every good poem can in no respect differ from that of good Prose.  I will go further. I do not doubt that it may be safely affirmed, that there neither is, nor can be, any essential difference between the language of prose and metrical composition.  We are fond of tracing the resemblance between Poetry and Painting, and, accordingly, we call them Sisters: but where shall we find bonds of connection sufficiently strict to typify the affinity betwixt metrical and prose composition?  They both speak by and to the same organs; the bodies in which both of them are clothed may be said to be of the same substance, their affections are kindred, and almost identical, not necessarily differing even in degree; <pb n="xxiv" teiform="pb"/>Poetry* sheds no tears [ldquo ]such as Angels weep,[rdquo ] but natural and human tears; she can boast of no celestial Ichor that distinguishes her vital juices from those of prose; the same human blood circulates through the veins of them both.</p>
          <p teiform="p">If it be affirmed that rhyme and metrical arrangement of themselves constitute a distinction which overturns what I have been saying on the strict <note place="foot" anchored="yes" teiform="note">* I here use the word [ldquo ]Poetry[rdquo ] (though against my own judgment) as opposed to the word Prose, and synonymous with metrical composition.  But much confusion has been introduced into criticism by this contradistinction of Poetry and Prose, instead of the more philosophical one of Poetry and Matter of Fact, or Science.  The only strict antithesis to Prose is Metre; nor is this, in truth, a <emph teiform="emph">strict</emph> antithesis; because lines and passages of metre so naturally occur in writing prose, that it would be scarcely possible to avoid them, even were it desirable.</note><pb n="xxv" teiform="pb"/>affinity of metrical language with that of prose, and paves the way for other artificial distinctions which the mind voluntarily admits, I answer that the language of such Poetry as I am recommending is, as far as is possible, a selection of the language really spoken by men; that this selection, wherever it is made with true taste and feeling, will of itself form a distinction far greater than would at first be imagined, and will entirely separate the composition from the vulgarity and meanness of ordinary life; and, if metre be superadded thereto, I believe that a dissimilitude will be produced altogether sufficient for the gratification of a rational mind.  What other distinction would we have?  Whence is it to come?  And where is it to exist?  Not, surely, where the Poet speaks through the mouths of his characters: it cannot be necessary here, either for elevation of style, or any of its supposed ornaments: for, if the Poet[rsquo ]s subject be judiciously chosen, it will <pb n="xxvi" teiform="pb"/>naturally, and upon fit occasion, lead him to passions the language of which, if selected truly and judiciously, must necessarily be dignified and variegated, and alive with metaphors and figures.  I forbear to speak of an incongruity which would shock the intelligent Reader, should the Poet interweave any foreign splendour of his own with that which the passion naturally suggests: it is sufficient to say that such addition is unnecessary.  And, surely, it is more probable that those passages, which with propriety abound with metaphors and figures, will have their due effect, if, upon other occasions where the passions are of a milder character, the style also be subdued and temperate.</p>
          <p teiform="p">But, as the pleasure which I hope to give by the Poems I now present to the Reader must depend entirely on just notions upon this subject, and, as it is in itself of the highest importance to our <pb n="xxvii" teiform="pb"/>taste and moral feelings, I cannot content myself with these detached remarks.  And if, in what I am about to say, it shall appear to some that my labour is unnecessary, and that I am like a man fighting a battle without enemies, I would remind such persons, that, whatever may be the language outwardly holden by men, a practical faith in the opinions which I am wishing to establish is almost entirely unknown.  If my conclusions are admitted, and carried as far as they must be carried if admitted at all, our judgments concerning the works of the greatest Poets both ancient and modern will be far different from what they are at present, both when we praise, and when we censure: and our moral feelings influencing, and influenced by these judgments will, I believe, be corrected and purified.</p>
          <p teiform="p">Taking up the subject, then, upon general grounds, I ask what is meant by the word Poet? <pb n="xxviii" teiform="pb"/>What is a Poet?  To whom does he address himself?  And what language is to be expected from him?  He is a man speaking to men: a man, it is true, endued with more lively sensibility, more enthusiasm and tenderness, who has a greater knowledge of human nature, and a more comprehensive soul, than are supposed to be common among mankind; a man pleased with his own passions and volitions, and who rejoices more than other men in the spirit of life that is in him; delighting to contemplate similar volitions and passions as manifested in the goings-on of the Universe, and habitually impelled to create them where he does not find them.  To these qualities he has added a disposition to be affected more than other men by absent things as if they were present; an ability of conjuring up in himself passions, which are indeed far from being the same as those produced by real events, yet (especially in those parts of the general <pb n="xxix" teiform="pb"/>sympathy which are pleasing and delightful) do more nearly resemble the passions produced by real events, than any thing which, from the motions of their own minds merely, other men are accustomed to feel in themselves; whence, and from practice, he has acquired a greater readiness and power in expressing what he thinks and feels, and especially those thoughts and feelings which, by his own choice, or from the structure of his own mind, arise in him without immediate external excitement.</p>
          <p teiform="p">But, whatever portion of this faculty we may suppose even the greatest Poet to possess, there cannot be a doubt but that the language which it will suggest to him, must, in liveliness and truth, fall far short of that which is uttered by men in real life, under the actual pressure of those passions, certain shadows of which the Poet thus produces, or feels to be produced, in himself. <pb n="xxx" teiform="pb"/>However exalted a notion we would wish to cherish of the character of a Poet, it is obvious, that, while he describes and imitates passions, his situation is altogether slavish and mechanical, compared with the freedom and power of real and substantial action and suffering.  So that it will be the wish of the Poet to bring his feelings near to those of the persons whose feelings he describes, nay, for short spaces of time perhaps, to let himself slip into an entire delusion, and even confound and identify his own feelings with theirs; modifying only the language which is thus suggested to him, by a consideration that he describes for a particular purpose, that of giving pleasure.  Here, then, he will apply the principle on which I have so much insisted, namely, that of selection; on this he will depend for removing what would otherwise be painful or disgusting in the passion; he will feel that there is no necessity to trick out or to elevate nature: and, the more <pb n="xxxi" teiform="pb"/>industriously he applies this principle, the deeper will be his faith that no words, which his fancy or imagination can suggest, will be to be compared with those which are the emanations of reality and truth.</p>
          <p teiform="p">But it may be said by those who do not object to the general spirit of these remarks, that, as it is impossible for the Poet to produce upon all occasions language as exquisitely fitted for the passion as that which the real passion itself suggests, it is proper that he should consider himself as in the situation of a translator, who deems himself justified when he substitutes excellences of another kind for those which are unattainable by him; and endeavours occasionally to surpass his original, in order to make some amends for the general inferiority to which he feels that he must submit.  But this would be to encourage idleness and unmanly despair.  Further, it is the <pb n="xxxii" teiform="pb"/>language of men who speak of what they do not understand; who talk of Poetry as of a matter of amusement and idle pleasure; who will converse with us as gravely about a <emph teiform="emph">taste</emph> for Poetry, as they express it, as if it were a thing as indifferent as a taste for Rope-dancing, or Frontiniac or Sherry.  Aristotle, I have been told, hath said, that Poetry is the most philosophic of all writing: it is so: its object is truth, not individual and local, but general, and operative; not standing upon external testimony, but carried alive into the heart by passion; truth which is its own testimony, which gives strength and divinity to the tribunal to which it appeals, and receives them from the same tribunal.  Poetry is the image of man and nature.  The obstacles which stand in the way of the fidelity of the Biographer and Historian, and of their consequent utility, are incalculably greater than those which are to be encountered by the Poet who has an adequate notion of <pb n="xxxiii" teiform="pb"/>the dignity of his art.  The Poet writes under one restriction only, namely, that of the necessity of giving immediate pleasure to a human Being possessed of that information which may be expected from him, not as a lawyer, a physician, a mariner, an astronomer or a natural philosopher, but as a Man.  Except this one restriction, there is no object standing between the Poet and the image of things; between this, and the Biographer and Historian there are a thousand.</p>
          <p teiform="p">Nor let this necessity of producing immediate pleasure be considered as a degradation of the Poet[rsquo ]s art.  It is far otherwise.  It is an acknowledgment of the beauty of the universe, an acknowledgment the more sincere, because it is not formal, but indirect; it is a task light and easy to him who looks at the world in the spirit of love: further, it is a homage paid to the native <pb n="xxxiv" teiform="pb"/>and naked dignity of man, to the grand elementary principle of pleasure, by which he knows, and feels, and lives, and moves.  We have no sympathy but what is propagated by pleasure: I would not be misunderstood; but wherever we sympathize with pain it will be found that the sympathy is produced and carried on by subtle combinations with pleasure.  We have no knowledge, that is, no general principles drawn from the contemplation of particular facts, but what has been built up by pleasure, and exists in us by pleasure alone.  The Man of Science, the Chemist and Mathematician, whatever difficulties and disgusts they may have had to struggle with, know and feel this.  However painful may be the objects with which the Anatomist[rsquo ]s knowledge is connected, he feels that his knowledge is pleasure; and where he has no pleasure he has no knowledge.  What then does the Poet?  He considers man and the objects that surround him <pb n="xxxv" teiform="pb"/>as acting and re-acting upon each other, so as to produce an infinite complexity of pain and pleasure; he considers man in his own nature and in his ordinary life as contemplating this with a certain quantity of immediate knowledge, with certain convictions, intuitions, and deductions which by habit become of the nature of intuitions; he considers him as looking upon this complex scene of ideas and sensations, and finding every where objects that immediately excite in him sympathies which, from the necessities of his nature, are accompanied by an overbalance of enjoyment.</p>
          <p teiform="p">To this knowledge which all men carry about with them, and to these sympathies in which without any other discipline than that of our daily life we are fitted to take delight, the Poet principally directs his attention.  He considers man and nature as essentially adapted to each other, <pb n="xxxvi" teiform="pb"/>and the mind of man as naturally the mirror of the fairest and most interesting qualities of nature.  And thus the Poet, prompted by this feeling of pleasure which accompanies him through the whole course of his studies, converses with general nature with affections akin to those, which, through labour and length of time, the Man of Science has raised up in himself, by conversing with those particular parts of nature which are the objects of his studies.  The knowledge both of the Poet and the Man of Science is pleasure; but the knowledge of the one cleaves to us as a necessary part of our existence, our natural and unalienable inheritance; the other is  a personal and individual acquisition, slow to come to us, and by no habitual and direct sympathy connecting us with our fellow-beings.  The Man of Science seeks truth as a remote and unknown benefactor; he cherishes and loves it in his solitude: the Poet, singing a song in which all human beings <pb n="xxxvii" teiform="pb"/>join with him, rejoices in the presence of truth as our visible friend and hourly companion.  Poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge; it is the impassioned expression which is in the countenance of all Science.  Emphatically may it be said of the Poet, as Shakespeare hath said of man, [ldquo ]that he looks before and after.[rdquo ]  He is the rock of defence of human nature; an upholder and preserver, carrying every where with him relationship and love.  In spite of difference of soil and climate, of language and manners, of laws and customs, in spite of things silently gone out of mind and things violently destroyed, the Poet binds together by passion and knowledge the vast empire of human society, as it is spread over the whole earth, and over all time.  The objects of the Poet[rsquo ]s thoughts are every where; though the eyes and senses of man are, it is true, his favourite guides, yet he will follow wheresoever he can find an atmosphere of sensation in which to move his <pb n="xxxviii" teiform="pb"/>wings.  Poetry is the first and last of all knowledge[mdash ]it is as immortal as the heart of man.  If the labours of Men of Science should ever create any material revolution, direct or indirect, in our condition, and in the impressions which we habitually receive, the Poet will sleep then no more than at present, but he will be ready to follow the steps of the Man of Science, not only in those general indirect effects, but he will be at his side, carrying sensation into the midst of the objects of the Science itself.  The remotest discoveries of the Chemist, the Botanist, or Mineralogist, will be as proper objects of the Poet[rsquo ]s art as any upon which it can be employed, if the time should ever come when these things shall be familiar to us, and the relations under which they are contemplated by the followers of these respective Sciences shall be manifestly and palpably material to us as enjoying and suffering beings.  If the time should ever come when what is now called <pb n="xxxix" teiform="pb"/>Science, thus familiarized to men, shall be ready to put on, as it were, a form of flesh and blood, the Poet will lend his divine spirit to aid the transfiguration, and will welcome the Being thus produced, as a dear and genuine inmate of the household of man.[mdash ]It is not, then, to be supposed that any one, who holds that sublime notion of Poetry which I have attempted to convey, will break in upon the sanctity and truth of his pictures by transitory and accidental ornaments, and endeavour to excite admiration of himself by arts, the necessity of which must manifestly depend upon the assumed meanness of his subject.</p>
          <p teiform="p">What I have thus far said applies to Poetry in general; but especially to those parts of composition where the Poet speaks through the mouths of his characters; and upon this point it appears to have such weight that I will conclude, there are few persons of good sense, who would not <pb n="xl" teiform="pb"/>allow that the dramatic parts of composition are defective, in proportion as they deviate from the real language of nature, and are coloured by a diction of the Poet[rsquo ]s own, either peculiar to him as an individual Poet, or belonging simply to Poets in general, to a body of men who, from the circumstance of their compositions being in metre, it is expected will employ a particular language.</p>
          <p teiform="p">It is not, then, in the dramatic parts of composition that we look for this distinction of language; but still it may be proper and necessary where the Poet speaks to us in his own person and character.  To this I answer by referring my Reader to the description which I have before given of a Poet.  Among the qualities which I have enumerated as principally conducing to form a Poet, is implied nothing differing in kind from other men, but only in degree. The sum of <pb n="xli" teiform="pb"/>what I have there said is, that the Poet is chiefly distinguished from other men by a greater promptness to think and feel without immediate external excitement, and a greater power in expressing such thoughts and feelings as are produced in him in that manner.  But these passions and thoughts and feelings are the general passions and thoughts and feelings of men.  And with what are they connected? Undoubtedly with our moral sentiments and animal sensations, and with the causes which excite these; with the operations of the elements and the appearances of the visible universe; with storm and sun-shine, with the revolutions of the seasons, with cold and heat, with loss of friends and kindred, with injuries and resentments, gratitude and hope, with fear and sorrow.  These, and the like, are the sensations and objects which the Poet describes, as they are the sensations of other men, and the objects which interest them.  The Poet thinks and feels in the <pb n="xlii" teiform="pb"/>spirit of the passions of men.  How, then, can his language differ in any material degree from that of all other men who feel vividly and see clearly?  It might be <emph teiform="emph">proved</emph> that it is impossible. But supposing that this were not the case, the Poet might then be allowed to use a peculiar language when expressing his feelings for his own gratification, or that of men like himself.  But Poets do not write for Poets alone, but for men.  Unless therefore we are advocates for that admiration which depends upon ignorance, and that pleasure which arises from hearing what we do not understand, the Poet must descend from this supposed height, and, in order to excite rational sympathy, he must express himself as other men express themselves.  To this it may be added, that while he is only selecting from the real language of men, or, which amounts to the same thing, composing accurately in the spirit of such selection, he is treading upon safe ground, and we know what we are to expect from <pb n="xliii" teiform="pb"/>him.  Our feelings are the same with respect to metre; for, as it may be proper to remind the Reader, the distinction of metre is regular and uniform, and not like that which is produced by what is usually called poetic diction, arbitrary, and subject to infinite caprices upon which no calculation whatever can be made.  In the one case, the Reader is utterly at the mercy of the Poet respecting what imagery or diction he may choose to connect with the passion, whereas, in the other, the metre obeys certain laws, to which the Poet and Reader both willingly submit because they are certain, and because no interference is made by them with the passion but such as the concurring testimony of ages has shown to heighten and improve the pleasure which co-exists with it.</p>
          <p teiform="p">It will now be proper to answer an obvious question, namely, Why, professing these opinions, have I written in verse?  To this, in addition to such <pb n="xliv" teiform="pb"/>answer as is included in what I have already said, I reply in the first place, Because, however I may have restricted myself, there is still left open to me what confessedly constitutes the most valuable object of all writing, whether in prose or verse, the great and universal passions of men, the most general and interesting of their occupations, and the entire world of nature, from which I am at liberty to supply myself with endless combinations of forms and imagery.  Now, supposing for a moment that whatever is interesting in these objects may be as vividly described in prose, why am I to be condemned, if to such description I have endeavoured to superadd the charm which, by the consent of all nations, is acknowledged to exist in metrical language?  To this, by such as are unconvinced by what I have already said, it may be answered, that a very small part of the pleasure given by Poetry depends upon the metre, and that it is injudicious to write in metre, unless it be accompanied with <pb n="xlv" teiform="pb"/>the other artificial distinctions of style with which metre is usually accompanied, and that by such deviation more will be lost from the shock which will be thereby given to the Reader[rsquo ]s associations, than will be counterbalanced by any pleasure which he can derive from the general power of numbers. In answer to those who still contend for the necessity of accompanying metre with certain appropriate colours of style in order to the accomplishment of its appropriate end, and who also, in my opinion, greatly under-rate the power of metre in itself, it might perhaps, as far as relates to these Poems, have been almost sufficient to observe, that poems are extant, written upon more humble subjects, and in a more naked and simple style than I have aimed at, which poems have continued to give pleasure from generation to generation.  Now, if nakedness and simplicity be a defect, the fact here mentioned affords a strong presumption that poems somewhat less naked and simple are capable of <pb n="xlvi" teiform="pb"/>affording pleasure at the present day; and, what I wished <emph teiform="emph">chiefly</emph> to attempt, at present, was to justify myself for having written under the impression of this belief.</p>
          <p teiform="p">But I might point out various causes why, when the style is manly, and the subject of some importance, words metrically arranged will long continue to impart such a pleasure to mankind as he who is sensible of the extent of that pleasure will be desirous to impart.  The end of Poetry is to produce excitement in co-existence with an overbalance of pleasure.  Now, by the supposition, excitement is an unusual and irregular state of the mind; ideas and feelings do not in that state succeed each other in accustomed order.  But, if the words by which this excitement is produced are in themselves powerful, or the images and feelings have an undue proportion of pain connected with them, there is some danger that the <pb n="xlvii" teiform="pb"/>excitement may be carried beyond its proper bounds.  Now the co-presence of something regular, something to which the mind has been accustomed in various moods and in a less excited state, cannot but have great efficacy in tempering and restraining the passion by an intertexture of ordinary feeling, and of feeling not strictly and necessarily connected with the passion.  This is unquestionably true, and hence, though the opinion will at first appear paradoxical, from the tendency of metre to divest language in a certain degree of its reality, and thus to throw a sort of half consciousness of unsubstantial existence over the whole composition, there can be little doubt but that more pathetic situations and sentiments, that is, those which have a greater proportion of pain connected with them, may be endured in metrical composition, especially in rhyme, than in prose.  The metre of the old ballads is very artless; yet they contain many passages which would illustrate this opinion, <pb n="xlviii" teiform="pb"/>and, I hope, if the following Poems be attentively perused, similar instances will be found in them.  This opinion may be further illustrated by appealing to the Reader[rsquo ]s own experience of the reluctance with which he comes to the re-perusal of the distressful parts of Clarissa Harlowe, or the Gamester.  While Shakespeare[rsquo ]s writings, in the most pathetic scenes, never act upon us as pathetic beyond the bounds of pleasure[mdash ]an effect which, in a much greater degree than might at first be imagined, is to be ascribed to small, but continual and regular impulses of pleasurable surprise from the metrical arrangement.[mdash ]On the other hand (what it must be allowed will much more frequently happen) if the Poet[rsquo ]s words should be incommensurate with the passion, and inadequate to raise the Reader to a height of desirable excitement, then, (unless the Poet[rsquo ]s choice of his metre has been grossly injudicious) in the feelings of pleasure which the Reader has been accustomed to con-<pb n="xlix" teiform="pb"/>nect with metre in general, and in the feeling, whether cheerful or melancholy, which he has been accustomed to connect with that particular movement of metre, there will be found something which will greatly contribute to impart passion to the words, and to effect the complex end which the Poet proposes to himself.</p>
          <p teiform="p">If I had undertaken a systematic defence of the theory upon which these poems are written, it would have been my duty to develope the various causes upon which the pleasure received from metrical language depends.  Among the chief of these causes is to be reckoned a principle which must be well known to those who have made any of the Arts the object of accurate reflection; I mean the pleasure which the mind derives from the perception of similitude in dissimilitude.  This principle is the great spring of the activity of our minds, and their chief feeder.  From this prin-<pb n="l" teiform="pb"/><lb teiform="lb"/><lb teiform="lb"/>ciple the direction of the sexual appetite, and all the passions connected with it, take their origin: it is the life of our ordinary conversation; and upon the accuracy with which similitude in dissimilitude, and dissimilitude in similitude are perceived, depend our taste and our moral feelings.  It would not have been a useless employment to have applied this principle to the consideration of metre, and to have shown that metre is hence enabled to afford much pleasure, and to have pointed out in what manner that pleasure is produced.  But my limits will not permit me to enter upon this subject, and I must content myself with a general summary.</p>
          <p teiform="p">I have said that Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity: the emotion is contemplated till by a species of reaction the tranquillity gradually disappears, and an emotion, <pb n="li" teiform="pb"/>kindred to that which was before the subject of contemplation, is gradually produced, and does itself actually exist in the mind.  In this mood successful composition generally begins, and in a mood similar to this it is carried on; but the emotion, of whatever kind and in whatever degree, from various causes is qualified by various pleasures, so that in describing any passions whatsoever, which are voluntarily described, the mind will upon the whole be in a state of enjoyment.  Now, if Nature be thus cautious in preserving in a state of enjoyment a being thus employed, the Poet ought to profit by the lesson thus held forth to him, and ought especially to take care, that whatever passions he communicates to his Reader, those passions, if his Reader[rsquo ]s mind be sound and vigorous, should always be accompanied with an overbalance of pleasure.  Now the music of harmonious metrical language, the sense of difficulty overcome, and the blind association of <pb n="lii" teiform="pb"/>pleasure which has been previously received from works of rhyme or metre of the same or similar construction, an indistinct perception perpetually renewed of language closely resembling that of real life, and yet, in the circumstance of metre, differing from it so widely, all these imperceptibly make up a complex feeling of delight, which is of the most important use in tempering the painful feeling which will always be found intermingled with powerful descriptions of the deeper passions. This effect is always produced in pathetic and impassioned poetry; while, in lighter compositions, the ease and gracefulness with which the Poet manages his numbers are themselves confessedly a principal source of the gratification of the Reader.  I might perhaps include all which it is <emph teiform="emph">necessary</emph> to say upon this subject by affirming, what few persons will deny, that of two descriptions, either of passions, manners, or characters, each of them equally well executed, the one in prose and the <pb n="liii" teiform="pb"/>other in verse, the verse will be read a hundred times where the prose is read once. We see that Pope, by the power of verse alone, has contrived to render the plainest common sense interesting, and even frequently to invest it with the appearance of passion.  In consequence of these convictions I related in metre the Tale of G<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">OODY</hi> B<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">LAKE</hi> and H<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">ARRY</hi> G<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">ILL</hi>, which is one of the rudest of this collection.  I wished to draw attention to the truth, that the power of the human imagination is sufficient to produce such changes even in our physical nature as might almost appear miraculous. The truth is an important one; the fact (for it is a <emph teiform="emph">fact</emph>) is a valuable illustration of it.  And I have the satisfaction of knowing that it has been communicated to many hundreds of people who would never have heard of it, had it not been narrated as a Ballad, and in a more impressive metre than is usual in Ballads.</p>
          <pb n="liv" teiform="pb"/>
          <p teiform="p">Having thus explained a few of the reasons why I have written in verse, and why I have chosen subjects from common life, and endeavoured to bring my language near to the real language of men, if I have been too minute in pleading my own cause, I have at the same time been treating a subject of general interest; and it is for this reason that I request the Reader[rsquo ]s permission to add a few words with reference solely to these particular poems, and to some defects which will probably be found in them.  I am sensible that my associations must have sometimes been particular instead of general, and that, consequently, giving to things a false importance, sometimes from diseased impulses I may have written upon unworthy subjects; but I am less apprehensive on this account, than that my language may frequently have suffered from those arbitrary connections of feelings and ideas with particular words <pb n="lv" teiform="pb"/>and phrases, from which no man can altogether protect himself. Hence I have no doubt, that, in some instances, feelings even of the ludicrous may be given to my Readers by expressions which appeared to me tender and pathetic. Such faulty expressions, were I convinced they were faulty at present, and that they must necessarily continue to be so, I would willingly take all reasonable pains to correct.  But it is dangerous to make these alterations on the simple authority of a few individuals, or even of certain classes of men; for where the understanding of an Author is not convinced, or his feelings altered, this cannot be done without great injury to himself: for his own feelings are his stay and support, and, if he sets them aside in one instance, he may be induced to repeat this act till his mind loses all confidence in itself, and becomes utterly debilitated. To this it may be added, that the Reader ought <pb n="lvi" teiform="pb"/>never to forget that he is himself exposed to the same errors as the Poet, and perhaps in a much greater degree: for there can be no presumption in saying, that it is not probable he will be so well acquainted with the various stages of meaning through which words have passed, or with the fickleness or stability of the relations of particular ideas to each other; and above all, since he is so much less interested in the subject, he may decide lightly and carelessly.</p>
          <p teiform="p">Long as I have detained my Reader, I hope he will permit me to caution him against a mode of false criticism which has been applied to Poetry in which the language closely resembles that of life and nature.  Such verses have been triumphed over in parodies of which Dr. Johnson[rsquo ]s stanza is a fair specimen. <pb n="lvii" teiform="pb"/><q direct="unspecified" teiform="q"><lg org="uniform" sample="complete" part="n" teiform="lg"><l part="n" teiform="l">[ldquo ]I put my hat upon my head,</l><l part="n" teiform="l">And walk[rsquo ]d into the Strand,</l><l part="n" teiform="l">And there I met another man</l><l part="n" teiform="l">Whose hat was in his hand.[rdquo ]</l></lg></q>Immediately under these lines I will place one of the most justly admired stanzas of the [ldquo ]<emph teiform="emph">Babes</emph> in the Wood.[rdquo ] <q direct="unspecified" teiform="q"><lg org="uniform" sample="complete" part="n" teiform="lg"><l part="n" teiform="l">[ldquo ]These pretty Babes with hand in hand</l><l part="n" teiform="l">Went wandering up and down;</l><l part="n" teiform="l">But never more they saw the Man</l><l part="n" teiform="l">Approaching from the Town.[rdquo ]</l></lg></q>In both of these stanzas the words, and the order of the words, in no respect differ from the most unimpassioned conversation.  There are words in both, for example, [ldquo ]the Strand,[rdquo ] and [ldquo ]the Town,[rdquo ] connected with none but the most familiar ideas; yet the one stanza we admit as admirable, and the other as a fair example of the <pb n="lviii" teiform="pb"/>superlatively contemptible.  Whence arises this difference? Not from the metre, not from the language, not from the order of the words; but the <emph teiform="emph">matter</emph> expressed in Dr. Johnson[rsquo ]s stanza is contemptible.  The proper method of treating trivial and simple verses, to which Dr. Johnson[rsquo ]s stanza would be a fair parallelism, is not to say, This is a bad kind of poetry, or This is not poetry; but This wants sense; it is neither interesting in itself, nor can <emph teiform="emph">lead</emph> to any thing interesting; the images neither originate in that sane state of feeling which arises out of thought, nor can excite thought or feeling in the Reader.  This is the only sensible manner of dealing with such verses. Why trouble yourself about the species till you have previously decided upon the genus?  Why take pains to prove that an ape is not a Newton when it is self-evident that he is not a man?</p>
          <pb n="lix" teiform="pb"/>
          <p teiform="p">I have one request to make of my Reader, which is, that in judging these Poems he would decide by his own feelings genuinely, and not by reflection upon what will probably be the judgment of others.  How common is it to hear a person say, [ldquo ]I myself do not object to this style of composition, or this or that expression, but to such and such classes of people it will appear mean or ludicrous.[rdquo ] This mode of criticism, so destructive of all sound unadulterated judgment, is almost universal: I have therefore to request, that the Reader would abide independently by his own feelings, and that if he finds himself affected he would not suffer such conjectures to interfere with his pleasure.</p>
          <p teiform="p">If an Author by any single composition has impressed us with respect for his talents, it is useful to consider this as affording a presumption, that, <pb n="lx" teiform="pb"/>on other occasions where we have been displeased, he nevertheless may not have written ill or absurdly; and, further, to give him so much credit for this one composition as may induce us to review what has displeased us with more care than we should otherwise have bestowed upon it.  This is not only an act of justice, but, in our decisions upon poetry especially, may conduce in a high degree to the improvement of our own taste: for an <emph teiform="emph">accurate</emph> taste in poetry, and in all the other arts, as Sir Joshua Reynolds has observed, is an <emph teiform="emph">acquired</emph> talent, which can only be produced by thought, and a long continued intercourse with the best models of composition.  This is mentioned, not with so ridiculous a purpose as to prevent the most inexperienced Reader from judging for himself, (I have already said that I wish him to judge for himself;) but merely to temper the rashness of decision, and to suggest, that, if <pb n="lxi" teiform="pb"/>Poetry be a subject on which much time has not been bestowed, the judgment may be erroneous; and that in many cases it necessarily will be so.</p>
          <p teiform="p">I know that nothing would have so effectually contributed to further the end which I have in view, as to have shown of what kind the pleasure is, and how the pleasure is produced, which is confessedly produced by metrical composition essentially different from that which I have here endeavoured to recommend: for the Reader will say that he has been pleased by such composition; and what can I do more for him?  The power of any art is limited; and he will suspect, that, if I propose to furnish him with new friends, it is only upon condition of his abandoning his old friends.  Besides, as I have said, the Reader is himself conscious of the pleasure which he has received <pb n="lxii" teiform="pb"/>from such composition, composition to which he has peculiarly attached the endearing name of Poetry; and all men feel an habitual gratitude, and something of an honorable bigotry for the objects which have long continued to please them; we not only wish to be pleased, but to be pleased in that particular way in which we have been accustomed to be pleased.  There is a host of arguments in these feelings; and I should be the less able to combat them successfully, as I am willing to allow, that, in order entirely to enjoy the Poetry which I am recommending, it would be necessary to give up much of what is ordinarily enjoyed.  But, would my limits have permitted me to point out how this pleasure is produced, I might have removed many obstacles, and assisted my Reader in perceiving that the powers of language are not so limited as he may suppose; and that it is possible that poetry may give other <pb n="lxiii" teiform="pb"/>enjoyments, of a purer, more lasting, and more exquisite nature.  This part of my subject I have not altogether neglected; but it has been less my present aim to prove, that the interest excited by some other kinds of poetry is less vivid, and less worthy of the nobler powers of the mind, than to offer reasons for presuming, that, if the object which I have proposed to myself were adequately attained, a species of poetry would be produced, which is genuine poetry; in its nature well adapted to interest mankind permanently, and likewise important in the multiplicity and quality of its moral relations.</p>
          <p teiform="p">From what has been said, and from a perusal of the Poems, the Reader will be able clearly to perceive the object which I have proposed to myself: he will determine how far I have attained <pb n="lxiv" teiform="pb"/>this object; and, what is a much more important question, whether it be worth attaining: and upon the decision of these two questions will rest my claim to the approbation of the public.</p>

The Reader will perhaps have a general notion of it, if he has ever known a man, a Captain of a small trading vessel, for example, who, being past the middle age of life, had retired upon an annuity or small independent income to some village or country town of which he was not a native, or in which he had not been accustomed to live. Such men, having little to do, become credulous and talkative from indolence; and from the same cause, and other predisposing causes by which it is probable that such men may have been affected, they are prone to superstition.  On which account it appeared to me proper to select a character like this to exhibit some of the general laws by which superstition acts upon the mind.  Superstitious men are almost always men of slow faculties and deep feelings: their minds are not loose but adhesive; they have a reasonable share of imagination, by which word I mean the faculty which produces impressive <pb n="202" teiform="pb"/><lb teiform="lb"/><lb teiform="lb"/>effects out of simple elements; but they are utterly destitute of fancy, the power by which pleasure and surprise are excited by sudden varieties of situation and by accumulated imagery.</p>

          <p teiform="p">It was my wish in this poem to shew the manner in which such men cleave to the same ideas; and to follow the turns of passion, always different, yet not palpably different, by which their conversation is swayed.  I had two objects to attain; first, to represent a picture which should not be unimpressive, yet consistent with the character that should describe it; secondly, while I adhered to the style in which such persons describe, to take care that words, which in their minds are impregnated with passion, should likewise convey passion to Readers who are not accustomed to sympathize with men feeling in that manner or using such language.  It seemed to me that this might be done by calling in the assistance of Lyrical and rapid Metre.  It was necessary that the Poem, to be natural, should in reality move slowly; yet I hoped, that, by the aid of the metre, to those who should at all enter into the spirit of the Poem, it would appear to move quickly.  The Reader will have the kindness to excuse this note, as I am sensible that an introductory Poem is necessary to give this Poem its full effect.</p>
          <p teiform="p">Upon this occasion I will request permission to add a few words closely connected with T<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">HE</hi> T<hi rend="small" teiform="hi">HORN</hi> and many other <pb n="203" teiform="pb"/><lb teiform="lb"/><lb teiform="lb"/>Poems in these Volumes.  There is a numerous class of readers who imagine that the same words cannot be repeated without tautology: this is a great error; virtual tautology is much oftener produced by using different words when the meaning is exactly the same.  Words, a Poet[rsquo ]s words more particularly, ought to be weighed in the balance of feeling, and not measured by the space which they occupy upon paper.  For the Reader cannot be too often reminded that Poetry is passion: it is the history or science of feelings: now every man must know that an attempt is rarely made to communicate impassioned feelings without something of an accompanying consciousness of the inadequateness of our own powers, or the deficiencies of language.  During such efforts there will be a craving in the mind, and as long as it is unsatisfied the Speaker will cling to the same words, or words of the same character.  There are also various other reasons why repetition and apparent tautology are frequently beauties of the highest kind.  Among the chief of these reasons is the interest which the mind attaches to words, not only as symbols of the passion, but as <emph teiform="emph">things</emph>, active and efficient, which are of themselves part of the passion.  And further, from a spirit of fondness, exultation, and gratitude, the mind luxuriates in the repetition of words which appear successfully to communicate its feelings.  The truth of these remarks might be shown by innumerable passages from the Bible, and from the impassioned Poetry of every nation.</p>
