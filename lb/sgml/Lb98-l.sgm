The evidence of this fact is to be sought, not in the writings of Critics, but in those of Poets themselves.</P><P>The majority of the following poems are to be  considered as experiments. They were written chiefly with a view to ascertain how far the language of conversation in the middle and lower cla<ORIG REND="long s">ss</ORIG>es of society is adapted to the purposes of poetic pleasure. Readers accu<ORIG REND="long s">s</ORIG>tomed to the <PB N="ii"><LB><LB>gaudiness and inane phraseology of many modern writers, if they persist in reading this book to its conclusion, will perhaps frequently have to <ORIG REND="long s">s</ORIG>truggle with feelings of <ORIG REND="long s">s</ORIG>trangeness and aukwardness : they will look round for poetry, and will be induced to enquire by what species of courtesy these attempts can be permitted to assume that title. It is desirable that such readers, for their own sakes, should not suffer the solitary word Poetry, a word of very disputed meaning, to stand in the way of their gratification; but that, while they are perusing this book, they should a<ORIG REND="long s">s</ORIG>k themselves if it contains a natural delineation of human pa<ORIG REND="long s">ss</ORIG>ions, human characters, and human incidents; and if the answer be favorable to the author&rsquo;s wishes, that they should consent to be pleased in spite of that mo<ORIG REND="long s">s</ORIG>t dreadful enemy to our pleasures, our own pre-established codes of decision.</P><PB N="iii"><LB><LB><P>Readers of superior judgment may disapprove of the style in which many of these pieces are executed it must be expected that many lines and phrases will not exactly suit their taste. It will perhaps appear to them, that wishing to avoid the prevalent fault of the day, the author has sometimes descended too low, and that many of his expressions are too familiar, and not of sufficient dignity. It is apprehended, that the more conversant the reader is with our elder writers, and with those in modern times who have been the mo<ORIG REND="long s">s</ORIG>t successful in painting manners and passions, the fewer complaints of this kind will he have to make.</P><P>An accurate taste in poetry, and in all the other arts, Sir Joshua Reynolds has observed, is an acquired talent, which can only be produced by severe thought, and a long continued intercourse with the best models of composition. This is <PB N="iv"><LB><LB>mentioned not with so ridiculous a purpose as to prevent the most inexperienced reader from judging for himself ; but merely to temper the rashness of decision, and to suggest that if poetry be a subject on which much time has not been bestowed, the judgment may be erroneous, and that in many cases it necessarily will be so.</P><P>The tale of Goody Blake and Harry Gill is founded on a well-authenticated fact which happened in Warwick<ORIG REND="long s">s</ORIG>hire. Of the other poems in the collection, it may be proper to say that they are either absolute inventions of the author, or facts which took place within his personal observation or that of his friends. The poem of the Thorn, as the reader will soon discover, is not supposed to be spoken in the author&rsquo;s own person : the character of the loquacious narrator will sufficiently shew itself in the course of the <ORIG REND="long s">s</ORIG>tory. The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere was profes- <PB N="v"><LB><LB>sedly written in imitation of the <EMPH>style</EMPH>, as well as of the spirit of the elder poets; but with a few exceptions, the Author believes that the language adopted in it has been equally intelligible for these three last centuries. The lines entitled Expostulation and Reply, and those which follow, arose out of conversation with a friend who was somewhat unreasonably attached to modern books of moral philosophy.</P></DIV><PB N="vi"><PB N="ttocr"><DIV TYPE="ttocr"><HEAD><EMPH>CONTENTS.</EMPH></HEAD><P REND="right">Page<LB>The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere . . . . 1 <LB>The Foster-Mother&rsquo;s Tale . . . . . . . 53 <LB>Lines left upon a Seat in a Yew-tree which stands <LB>near the Lake of Esthwaite . . . . . 59 <LB>The Nightingale, a Conversational Poem . . 63 <LB>The Female Vagrant . . . . . . . . 69 <LB>Goody Blake and Harry Gill . . . . . . 85 <LB>Lines written at a small distance from my House, <LB>and sent by my little Boy to the Person to <LB>whom they are addressed  . . . . . 95 <LB>Simon Lee, the old Huntsman  . . . . . 98 <LB>Anecdote for Fathers . . . . . . . . 105 <LB>We are seven . . . . . . . . . . . 110 <LB>Lines written in early spring  . . . . . . 115 <LB>The Thorn  . . . . . . . . . . . 117 <LB>The last of the Flock  . . . . . . . . 133 <LB>The Dungeon  . . . . . . . . . . . 139 <LB>The Mad Mother . . . . . . . . . 141 <LB>The Idiot Boy  . . . . . . . . . . 149 <LB>Lines written near Richmond, upon the Thames, <LB>at Evening   . . . . . . . . . . 180 <LB>Expostulation and Reply  . . . . . . . 183 <LB>The Tables turned; an Evening Scene, on the <LB>same subject . . . . . . . . . 186 <LB>Old Man travelling . . . . . . . . . 189 <LB>The Complaint of a forsaken Indian Woman . 193 <LB>The Convict  . . . . . . . . . . . 197 <LB>Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey  201 </P></DIV><PB N="ttocv"></BODY></TEXT><TEXT ID="baa0024"><PB N="1"><FRONT><LB><LB><LB><TITLEPAGE><DOCTITLE><TITLEPART>THE RIME<LB><LB><HI REND="small">OF THE</HI><LB><LB>ANCYENT MARINERE,<LB><LB><HI REND="small">IN<LB><LB>SEVEN PARTS.</HI><LB><LB><LB><LB></TITLEPART></DOCTITLE></TITLEPAGE><PB N="2"><PB N="3"><ARGUMENT><HEAD><EMPH><LB><LB><LB><LB>ARGUMENT.</EMPH></HEAD><P>How a Ship having passed the Line was driven by Storms to the cold Country towards the South Pole; and how from thence she made her course to the tropical Latitude of the Great Pacific Ocean; and of the strange things that befell; and in what manner the Ancyent Marinere came back to his own Country.</P></ARGUMENT><PB N="4"></FRONT><BODY><PB N="5"><LB><LB><HEAD>THE RIME<LB><LB><HI REND="small">OF THE</HI><LB><LB>ANCYENT MARINERE,<LB><LB><HI REND="small">IN SEVEN PARTS.</HI></HEAD><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD>I.</HEAD><LG N="1" TYPE="stanza"><L N="1">It is an ancyent Marinere, </L><L N="2" REND="indent">And he stoppeth one of three: </L><L N="3">&ldquo;By thy long grey beard and thy glittering eye </L><L N="4" REND="indent">&ldquo;Now wherefore stoppest me?</L></LG><LG N="2" TYPE="stanza"><L N="5">&ldquo;The Bridegroom&rsquo;s doors are open&rsquo;d wide </L><L N="6" REND="indent">&ldquo;And I am next of kin; </L><L N="7">&ldquo;The Guests are met, the Feast is <ORIG REND="long s">s</ORIG>et,&mdash;</L><L N="8" REND="indent">&ldquo;May&rsquo;st hear the merry din. </L></LG><PB N="6"><LB><LB><LG N="3"><L N="9">But still he holds the wedding-guest&mdash; </L><L N="10" REND="indent">There was a Ship, quoth he&mdash;</L><L N="11">&ldquo;Nay, if thou&rsquo;st got a laughsome tale, </L><L N="12" REND="indent">&ldquo;Marinere!

And so I dare to hope</L><L N="67">Though changed, no doubt, from what I was, when first</L><L N="68">I came among these hills; when like a roe</L><L N="69">I bounded o&rsquo;er the mountains, by the sides</L><L N="70">Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,</L><L N="71">Wherever nature led; more like a man</L><L N="72">Flying from something that he dreads, than one</L><L N="73">Who sought the thing he loved.  For nature then</L><L N="74">(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,</L><L N="75">And their glad animal movements all gone by,)</L><L N="76">To me was all in all.&mdash;I cannot paint</L><PB N="206"><LB><LB><L N="77">What then I was.  The sounding cataract</L><L N="78">Haunted me like a passion : the tall rock,</L><L N="79">The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,</L><L N="80">Their colours and their forms, were then to me</L><L N="81">An appetite: a feeling and a love,</L><L N="82">That had no need of a remoter charm,</L><L N="83">By thought supplied, or any interest</L><L N="84">Unborrowed from the eye.&mdash;That time is past,</L><L N="85">And all its aching joys are now no more,</L><L N="86">And all its dizzy raptures.  Not for this</L><L N="87">Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur: other gifts</L><L N="88">Have followed, for such loss, I would believe,</L><L N="89">Abundant recompence.  For I have learned</L><L N="90">To look on nature, not as in the hour</L><L N="91">Of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes</L><L N="92">The still, sad music of humanity,</L><L N="93">Not harsh nor grating, though of ample power</L><PB N="207"><LB><LB><L N="94">To chasten and subdue.  And I have felt</L><L N="95">A presence that disturbs me with the joy</L><L N="96">Of elevated thoughts ; a sense sublime</L><L N="97">Of something far more deeply interfused,</L><L N="98">Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,</L><L N="99">And the round ocean, and the living air,</L><L N="100">And the blue sky, and in the mind of man,</L><L N="101">A motion and a spirit, that impels</L><L N="102">All thinking things, all objects of all thought,</L><L N="103">And rolls through all things.  Therefore am I still </L><L N="104">A lover of the meadows and the woods,</L><L N="105">And mountains; and of all that we behold</L><L N="106">From this green earth; of all the mighty world</L><L N="107">Of eye and ear, both what they half-create,*</L></LG><NOTE PLACE="foot">* This line has a close resemblance to an admirable line of Young, the exact expression of which I cannot recollect.</NOTE><PB N="208"><LB><LB><LG N="4"><L N="108">And what perceive; well pleased to recognize</L><L N="109">In nature and the language of the sense,</L><L N="110">The anchor of my pure<ORIG REND="long s">s</ORIG>t thoughts, the nurse,</L><L N="111">The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul</L><L N="112" PART="i">Of all my moral being.</L></LG><LG N="5" TYPE="verse paragraph"><L PART="f">               Nor, perchance,</L><L N="113">If I were not thus taught, should I the more</L><L N="114">Suffer my genial spirits to decay: </L><L N="115">For thou art with me, here, upon the banks</L><L N="116">Of this fair river; thou, my deare<ORIG REND="long s">s</ORIG>t Friend,</L><L N="117">My dear, dear Friend, and in thy voice I catch</L><L N="118">The language of my former heart, and read</L><L N="119">My former pleasures in the shooting lights</L><L N="120">Of thy wild eyes.
